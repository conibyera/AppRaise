# AppRaise: App for Quantifying Uncertainty in Systematic Reviews
This app uses a posterior mixture model to quantify evidence uncertainty in systematic reviews.
It is written in R and can be run on R Studio.
To make a posterior model run much faster, please save it as a file in a separate folder after it is compiled in C++ using RStan.
You can then load the model file to run your analysis.
